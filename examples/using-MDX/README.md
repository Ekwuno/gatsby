  Using MDX Example 
</h1>

This repository demonstrates how to add MDX pages to a new Gatsby site.

---

In this section you will see two examples of using MDX, one of which is from a 3rd party react library and another that shows how to use exisitng components with MDX.

## ðŸ”§ Running locally

The site can be run locally on your own computer as well. By following these steps:

1.  Clone the `gatsby` repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby.git
```

2.  Navigate to the example

```shell
cd gatsby/examples/using-MDX
```

3.  Install the dependencies for the application by running

```shell

npm install

```

4.  Run the Gatsby development server

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Clone the site, navigate into it, and start it up.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gatsbyjs/webinar-using-mdx.git

cd webinar-using-mdx

npm install

gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`, you can see the MDX example page at `http://localhost:8000/chart-info`
